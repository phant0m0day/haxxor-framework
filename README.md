# haxxor-framework: testing version
Welcome to the haxxor-framework testing repository. New features will be pushed to this repository before they are launched to the main version. After a week of testing, if the features work and are efficient, they will be pushed to the main one. If not, they will be worked on in the testing repository until they are efficient and work.

## How long will haxxor-framework v.2 take?
To have a fully functioning tool (that is always being updated), it takes a lot of effort and time. Versions like 1.9 take a short amount of time to make, but 2.0 will take roughly a month to have done (main version, testing version will come a week before the main version)

## How long do I wait?
Version 1.9 testing will be out a few days after Christmas (if you're into Christmas. If not, December 31st, 2016 is when). The main version will be pushed a week after that.

## Can I contribute?
Yes, I will accept pull requests and fix issues as they come and don't be afraid to email at either phant0m0day@gmail.com or pentestwizard@gmail.com. Also, if you want to join development, email me.
